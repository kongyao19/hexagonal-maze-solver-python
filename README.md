# Hexagonal Maze A* Solver üó∫Ô∏è

A Python-based hexagonal maze solver that demonstrates artificial intelligence pathfinding using the A* search algorithm with dynamic cost systems, environmental hazards, and interactive visualization.

## Features

- **Hexagonal Grid Navigation**: Six-directional movement with proper offset coordinate handling for even/odd rows
- **A* Search Algorithm**: Informed search with admissible heuristic for guaranteed optimal solutions
- **Dynamic Cost System**: Movement costs modified by environmental effects (traps and rewards)
- **Multiple Optimization Modes**: Minimize steps, energy consumption, or balanced combination
- **Complex Trap Mechanics**: Energy multipliers, step modifiers, teleportation, and path invalidation
- **Reward System**: Beneficial effects that reduce movement costs
- **Interactive Visualization**: Beautiful matplotlib-based hexagonal grid with animated solution paths
- **Permutation-Based Heuristic**: Evaluates all treasure collection orderings for optimal cost estimation
- **State Management**: Comprehensive state tracking with effect stacking and energy constraints

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.7+
- **Libraries**: matplotlib, heapq, itertools
- **Core Concepts Applied**:
  - A* search algorithm with priority queues
  - Admissible and consistent heuristic functions
  - Hexagonal grid mathematics (cube coordinate conversion)
  - State space search and graph traversal
  - Dynamic programming for path optimization
  - Object-oriented design with state encapsulation

## How to Run

**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and pip installed

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version
```

**Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kongyao19/hexagonal-maze-solver-python.git
cd hexagonal-maze-solver-python
```

**Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

**Run the solver**:

```bash
python hexagonal_maze_solver.py
```

**Select optimization mode** when prompted:
- Type `steps` to minimize total steps taken
- Type `energy` to minimize energy consumption  
- Type `combined` for balanced optimization (default)

The program will display the original maze, execute the search, and visualize the optimal solution path.

## Game Rules

### Maze Components

| Component | Symbol | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Trap 1** | ‚äñ | Doubles energy cost for future moves |
| **Trap 2** | ‚äï | Doubles step count for future moves |
| **Trap 3** | ‚äó | Teleports player 2 steps forward in last direction |
| **Trap 4** | ‚äò | Invalidates entire path (instant failure) |
| **Reward 1** | ‚äû | Halves energy cost for future moves |
| **Reward 2** | ‚ä† | Halves step count for future moves |
| **Treasure** | üü† | Must collect all 4 to complete maze |
| **Obstacle** | ‚¨õ | Blocks movement completely |

### Gameplay

- Player starts at entry point (0, 0) with 50 energy units
- Goal: Collect all 4 treasures optimally while avoiding Trap 4
- Each move costs 1 step and 1 energy unit (base cost)
- Effects from traps/rewards modify movement costs dynamically
- Game ends when all treasures collected or path becomes invalid

### Algorithm Details

**A* Evaluation Function**:
```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
```
- **g(n)**: Actual cost from start (steps, energy, or combined)
- **h(n)**: Heuristic estimate using hexagonal distance and permutation optimization

**Hexagonal Distance Calculation**:
- Converts offset coordinates to cube coordinates
- Uses Manhattan distance in 3D cube space: `max(|x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÇ|, |y‚ÇÅ-y‚ÇÇ|, |z‚ÇÅ-z‚ÇÇ|)`

**Heuristic Properties**:
- Admissible: Never overestimates true cost
- Consistent: Satisfies triangle inequality
- Optimal: Evaluates all treasure collection orderings

### Winning Strategy

The algorithm finds optimal paths by:
1. Prioritizing states with lowest f(n) scores
2. Considering all possible treasure collection orders
3. Applying current effects to cost estimates
4. Avoiding Trap 4 and managing energy constraints
5. Balancing steps and energy based on selected mode

## Example Output
